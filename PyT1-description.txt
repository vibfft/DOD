Write a python script that takes two named arguments, 'file' and 'repeat'
(e.g., 'script.py --file ~/test_input_file.txt --repeat 8'). The 'repeat'
argument should have a default value of 2 if it is not not specified by the
user. The 'file' argument should be the full path of a text file.

The script should print a list of the unique lines in the file 'file', and the
number of times that line appears in the file. In addition, the text of each
unique line should be repeated in a comma-separated list a random number of
times, between 1 and the 'repeat' argument.

The output should be sorted by the number of times each line appears in 'file'.

Example:

    For file:
        aaa 
        aaa 
        bbb 
        aaa 
        bbb 
        ccc 
        aaa 
        bbb 
        ccc 
        ddd 
        aaa 
        bbb 
        ccc 
        ddd 
        eee 
        fff 
        zzz
        zzz

    A valid output would be:
        eee,eee 1
        fff,fff,fff,fff,fff,fff 1
        zzz,zzz,zzz,zzz,zzz,zzz,zzz 2
        ddd 2
        ccc,ccc,ccc,ccc 3
        bbb,bbb,bbb,bbb,bbb 4
        aaa,aaa,aaa 5
